# 🌿 Goal of the App
Social media today feels like a race — algorithm-driven, fast-fed, and filled with noise. It rewards speed over thought, reactions over reflection. I’ve long wished for a different kind of space — one that brings back the quiet excitement of waiting for something new, where posts are made with intention, and simplicity feels satisfying again.

I’ve waited for years, but social media only ran faster in the opposite direction.

Here’s what I wish for instead:

A place where people ***think before posting*** — not compete for visibility.

A place that’s ***slow by design***, where anticipation is part of the fun.

A place that feels ***calm and patient***, where anticipation replaces arguments and keyboard wars.

A place that reminds me of ***old games*** — simple, clunky, yet deeply joyful — while blending in what's new in modern time.

So I’m building it.
I don’t know if it will be “better,” but I know it’s the kind of social media I’ve always wanted to exist.


# 🐢 Core Features
## Turtie (Post)
Like any social media, you can create, edit, or delete your posts — but here, we call them "***turties***". Each turtie represents a thought you’ve chosen to share with patience and care.

## Egg System (Post Incubation)
When you create a ***turtie***, it doesn’t appear instantly. Instead, you receive an ***egg*** — a symbol of anticipation. Your egg will hatch anywhere between 20 minutes to 24 hours(for demo purpose, it's just a few seconds), revealing your turtie when it’s ready. Since each time you might receive a different egg, so you might receive a very special egg out of luck!

## Comments
You can create, edit, delete, and like comments on both turties and other comments — simple interactions that help you connect with other turtler.

## Tur-Boy (Sidebar Console)
Inspired by the Game Boy, Tur-Boy serves as your interactive sidebar console. It lets you check your profile stats, including followers, egg collections, activity, and incubation progress — all wrapped in nostalgic pixel-art charm.

## Authentication
Sign up via your favorite social accounts or register with your email and password. Once you join, you officially become a ***Turtler***! Password recovery and updates are supported for a smooth experience.

## Profile
Your profile showcases who you are. In the ***About*** tab, you’ll find your personal info and stats — and you can edit them anytime.

## Nest
Located on your profile page, the ***Nest*** tab is where all your eggs live. Check your egg collection, track the one that is currently incubating, and celebrate each new hatch.

## Pond
The ***Pond*** tab is your social space — see your followers and the Turtlers you follow. It’s calm, clear, and free from the noise of typical feeds.

## Shells (Media Library)
- In the Shells tab, the ***Uploads*** subtab is where you can see your media uploaded via turties.
- In ***Album*** subtab you can view, create, edit, or delete your media albums — your personal gallery of shared memories and creations.

# Why This Design?
## Turtle Theme
The turtle represents what this app stands for — a slow-paced, relaxing kind of social media. It’s not about racing to catch up; it’s about slowing down, taking your time, and enjoying the journey.

## Egg System

🥚 ***Incubation***: Waiting becomes part of the fun. Just like a turtle egg, posts and interactions take time to “hatch,” turning patience into playful anticipation.

🎁 ***Collection***: There are many types of eggs to discover — each one a small surprise for those who take things slow.

🌊 ***Turtle Events***: In the future, collected eggs can be used for trading, decorating profiles, or joining community events.

## Tur-Boy
Inspired by the nostalgic ***Game Boy***, Tur-Boy replaces the traditional sidebar with a retro-styled console. It lets you check your stats and explore features — while keeping that warm, pixel-era charm that reminds you of simpler, happier times.
